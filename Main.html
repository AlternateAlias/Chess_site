    My name is Jadon Muffett. I am officially 1006 USCF, with around a 1200 strength (If you're unaware of what a "rating" is, that will be explored in the "resources" section). I've been playing for about five years, and I've accumulated much experience/wisdom over such a time. On the grand scale of things,
    I'm far from being the best of players (like, very far!), but hopefully this archive of resources serves to accelerate your Chess growth in a meaningful way! Have fun reading!

    This is the main page of "THEChessSite.com". This is for complete beginners, 
    who are unaware of the rules, and/or people who need a refresher in the game of Chess.
