    <p1>When it comes to learning Chess, there is a nigh-infinite amount of resources to choose from.
        There are countless websites (like this one), books, videos, etc. and all of them mainly serve
        to accelerate your growth in this wondrous game of ours.

    <li><a href = "lichess.org">Lichess.org</a></li>
    <p1>Lichess is an entirely free website that has Puzzles, an Analysis Board, Studies and more! Just sign up, and you get full access to everything.
        This is my favorite website to both play and learn on.
